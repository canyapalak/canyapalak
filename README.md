- 👋 Hi, I’m Can Yapalak, a Web Dev student residing in Berlin, Germany.
- 👀 As a professional who has worked in the field of localization and translation for many years and has also been interested in machine translation,
  I can't wait to see where this new adventure will take me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a Full-Stack Web Dev at Code Academy Berlin and spending all my time and energy in this new field of expertise.
- 💞️ When I finish my education, I aim to start working as a full-time web developer at a company and keep on progressing with experience.
